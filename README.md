Project: Secure Data Transmission Using Cryptography and Steganography

Objective & Problem Statement:
The objective of this project was to develop a secure data transmission system by integrating Diffie-Hellman key exchange, AES encryption, and steganography techniques. It aimed to address the problem of data security and privacy in digital communication, ensuring that confidential messages remain protected from unauthorized access.

Methods, Approaches, and Tools Used:

Cryptography: Implemented Diffie-Hellman key exchange for secure key sharing and AES encryption for data protection.
Steganography: Used image, video, and audio steganography to embed encrypted messages into media files, making the communication covert.
Tools & Technologies: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Crypto Library, NumPy, PIL (for image processing), pydub (for audio), and moviepy (for video).

Responsibilities & Tasks Undertaken:

I provided the core idea for the project and handled the coding and implementation.
Developed Diffie-Hellman key exchange for secure key sharing.
Implemented AES encryption and decryption for data protection.
Integrated steganography algorithms for hiding encrypted data in media files.
Simulated brute-force attacks to estimate the cracking time of encryption.

Teamwork & Contribution:

This was a group project, where I played a key role in the technical development.
I was responsible for writing the code, troubleshooting issues, and optimizing performance.
Collaborated with teammates for research, testing, and documentation.

Outcomes & Impact:

Successfully developed a secure data transmission system that encrypts messages and hides them in media files.
The system enhances privacy and security by combining cryptographic and steganographic techniques.
Demonstrated how modern encryption and hiding methods can protect sensitive information from cyber threats.
This project provided valuable insights into real-world security challenges and strengthened my understanding of cryptography, cybersecurity, and secure communication.
